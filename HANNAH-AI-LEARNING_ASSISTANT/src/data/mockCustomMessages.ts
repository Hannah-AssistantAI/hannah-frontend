    originalMessage: 'Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.',
    customizedMessage: 'Recursion is a fundamental programming technique where a function calls itself to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Think of it like Russian nesting dolls - each doll contains a smaller version of itself. A recursive function needs: 1) A base case (stopping condition), 2) A recursive case (where the function calls itself with modified parameters).',

    customizedMessage: 'Binary search is an efficient O(log n) algorithm for finding an item in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. Here\'s how it works: 1) Start with the middle element, 2) If the target equals the middle, we\'re done, 3) If target is less than middle, search the left half, 4) If target is greater, search the right half. This is much faster than linear search for large datasets!',

Classes are blueprints that define properties and behaviors, while objects are instances of classes.

    customizedMessage: 'Variables are named containers that store data values in your program. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put different types of information. In most programming languages, you need to: 1) Declare the variable (create the box), 2) Optionally specify its type (what kind of data), 3) Initialize it with a value (put something in the box).
